            <img src="images/me.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Savanah Santos">
            <p>My name is Savanah Santos. I was born and raised in Southern Utah. I love being surrounded
                by the mountains. I have been married for just over 8 years. I met my husband while serving
                a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Oklahoma. Thanks to my mission 
                and marrying my husband, I am now fluent in the Spanish language. We now own a construction business 
                called Santos Roofing & Construction. We don't have any children yet, but we have 15 full grown chickens,
                10 baby chicks, 3 roosters, 4 dogs, and a cat!

            <p>Utah is known for its scenic beauty. Surrounded by mountains, beautiful winters, and is also known as the behive 
                state. It is also where the headquarters are located for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. There 
                are many beautiful national parks with hiking trails. Many people travel to Utah to visit these locations.
