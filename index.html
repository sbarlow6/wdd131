    <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hello, my name is Dery Henriquez I am from Tegucigalpa, Honduras. I currently work as a diesel truck mechanic 
        in my own company, I really enjoy sharing my knowledge with others but especially with my children since knowledge 
        is the treasure that no one can take away from others. Thanks to this work I have been able to meet many people from 
        different parts of the world which is gratifying. I'm currently studying web and computer programming since I've always 
        had an interest in learning about programming and I really like it. </p>

    <img src="images/bjj.jpg" alt="My Hobby" width="150">
    <p>I currently practice Brazilian jiu jitsu with my children which I love and love because 
        I can spend time with my children and at the same time they learn discipline.  
        I like to build furniture for my home with my children to teach them that skill, 
        I am currently studying Web Development to be able to work in family businesses 
        and drive them to a better future</p>

<h3>Tegucigalpa, Honduras</h3>
<img src="images/flag.jpeg" alt="Honduran Flag" width="300">
<p>The Honduran flag is a horizontal triband of turquoise (or blue) and white, with five turquoise stars 
    in the center of the white stripe. The stars represent the five original Central American nations, and the 
    stripes symbolize the Pacific and Caribbean Seas, with the white band representing the land between them. Tegucigalpa,
     the capital of Honduras, was founded in 1578 on the site of an existing indigenous settlement</p>
